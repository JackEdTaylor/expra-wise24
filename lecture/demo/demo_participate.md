# Participate

Here, you will find instructions on how to participate in the Demo experiment.

## **Step 1**: Ensure PsychoPy is installed

First, as we'll be using psychopy, make sure you have correctly installed the standalone installation of PsychoPy, as explained in the [setup page](https://jackedtaylor.github.io/expra-wise24/introduction/setup.html).

## **Step 2**: Download and Extract the Files

**a**) [Download the Psychopy experiment](demo_experiment.zip) as a `.zip` folder.

**b**) Extract the files from the `.zip` folder, and put them in a relevant folder for the ExPra.

**c**) Make sure that all the files are in the same folder. The files inside the demo experiment folder should look something like this:

## **Step 3**: Take Part!

In the experiment, you will be rating German words on "concreteness", on a scale from *1* (abstrakt) to *5* (konkret). These terms will be explained fully at the start of the experiment, but if you still have any questions then just ask.

To start the experiment, simply open `demo_experiment.psyexp` with PsychoPy. Once in the experiment, click the *Run experiment* button, circled below. The experiment should take around 10 minutes.

## **Step 4**: Check the Data

Now that you've taken part, you want to check that the experiment has saved your responses. In the demo experiment folder, if you now enter the `data` folder, you should see 3 files: a `.csv` file, a `.log` file, and a `.psydat` file.

Open the `.csv` file: you should have 100 rows (one for each trial), containing columns that store lots of relevant information about the stimuli and the experiment. Check that the first column, `word`, contains all of the words that you rated. The column `resp_scale.response` should contain your ratings, and the column `resp_scale.rt` should contain your response times (in seconds). If that's all there, then you're good to go!

## **Step 5**: Send the Data

If the data all look to be there, you can upload and send the `.csv` containing your data to the `demo-data` channel in the Discord server.

That's it, you're done!
