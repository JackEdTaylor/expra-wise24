# Overview

In this ExPra (Empirisch-Experimentelles Praktikum), you will get hands-on experience in Psychological research. We will progress through the stages of a research project, from theoretical background and methodological understanding, to experiment design, data collection, analysis, and presentation of results in a poster, presentation, and report.

#### How do I get all the software and do I have to apply for a loan to get it?

Everything we will use is [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) or at minimum free of charge and publicly available. You can find details on how to set up software for the course in the [Setup](https://jackedtaylor.github.io/expra-wise23/introduction/setup.html) section of this book.

#### Where is everything?

All course materials (lecture slides, lecture demo notebooks, lab notebooks, homework assignments, etc.) will be available on the [course website](https://jackedtaylor.github.io/expra-wise23/), i.e. the one you're looking at right now. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) you are **free to explore, enhance and share**. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up for the entire duration of the course and beyond, ideally to end of the internet. The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.

#### How to get those credits?


##### Exams and Assignments


##### Grading



##### Late Homework & Extension Policy

*Homework assignments* will usually have a clearly stated deadline, so as to manage course load clearly. Exceptions will be communicated. Please check the respective sections of this course and don't hesitate to ask questions if things are unclear. Generally, *Homework assignments* must be turned in by the deadline in order to to earn participation credits for the course and receive full scores. Homework assignments must be turned in on the due date in order to receive full credit. Homework assignment turned in less than 1 week late will be accepted but the score will be penalized by 10%. Homework has to be handed in via e-mail.

Late *homework assignments* will also be accepted under _exceptional circumstances_ (e.g., medical or family emergency etc.) and at the discretion of the instructor (e.g. exceptional denotes a rare event) with no penalty. This policy allowing for exceptional circumstances is definitely a right, but courtesy to be used when needed and not abused. Should you encounter such circumstances, simply email the assignment to instructor and note "late submission due to exceptional circumstances". **You do not need to provide any further justification or personally revealing information regarding the details.**


##### Academic Honor Code

You are encouraged to discuss problem sets with classmates and work on them together, but certain written submissions must reflect your own, original work. If you worked with other students on a problem set, no worries, please include their names in a statement like "I worked on this homework with XX and YY" on the assignment. If in doubt, ask the instructor.
**Using online-ressources to help you programm is endorsed and advised, but please note that if code is copied from the internet without alterations and not clearly marked as such, this will be understood as an attempt at deception and treated as such.** The same goes for any kind of reproduction of any other published work, as per usual.


##### Notice about missed work due to religious holy days

We might miss some things, so please notify the instructors of your pending absence at least 7 days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
